Security Assessment Summary:

1.  Dependency Vulnerabilities: The project uses several dependencies. A scan should be performed to identify and address any known vulnerabilities in these dependencies. Tools like `npm audit` (for frontend) and `safety check` (for backend) can be used.

2.  Authentication and Authorization: The API endpoints use authentication. Ensure that the authentication mechanism (likely JWT) is properly configured and protected against common attacks. Review the `app/core/security.py` file.

3.  Input Validation: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Use Pydantic schemas to enforce data types and constraints.

4.  CORS Configuration: The CORS configuration in `src/main.py` allows all origins during development. Restrict this to specific origins in production to prevent unauthorized access.

5.  Secret Key Management: The `SECRET_KEY` is read from the environment. Ensure that it is securely generated and stored, and not exposed in the codebase.

6.  Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to prevent sensitive information from being leaked in error messages.

7.  Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks.

8.  HTTPS: Enforce HTTPS to protect data in transit.

9.  Database Security: Ensure that the database is properly configured and secured, including using strong passwords and limiting access.

10. Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
